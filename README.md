# Rorschach Test

This is a simple Python program that I wrote in high-school for a Psychology project.
Note that the directories are hardcoded into the program.

Upon running the program, the user will experience a variety of radomly generated images and then will respond to the prompts. Completion of viewing the 10 images will result in a conclusion about the viewers mental state.
